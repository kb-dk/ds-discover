# SolrShield setup

#
# Design goals are
# 1) No requests should cause OOM or DOS (Out Of Memory or Denial Of Service)
# 2) Allow as much request freedom as possible
# 3) Estimate the cost (aka load) of a request and deny it if it is too heavy
#
# A weight is calculated for the separate parts of the query and added to a total weight.
# The total weight goes from 0 and upwards, aiming for ~1000 as cutoff limit.
# Weights are floating point, to allow for scaling factors to be less than 1.

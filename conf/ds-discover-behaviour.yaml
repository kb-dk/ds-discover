# This config contains behaviour data: Thread allocation, allowed fields for lookup, limits for arguments etc.

# The behaviour config is normally controlled by developers and is part of the code repository.
# Sensitive information such as machine names and user/passwords should not be part of this config.

# It will be automatically merged with the environment config when accessed through the
